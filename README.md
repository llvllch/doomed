# We're Doomed - A Fear and Greed index OLED visualiser for Bitcoin

Doom is a first-person-shooter from the 1990s. The health status monitor was one of the many brilliant things about it.

This code visualises the [Fear and Greed Bitcoin index](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/visualiser) using the Doom health monitor icon on a 128x128 RGB OLED (**SSD1351**) screen. It can easily be adapted to pretty much any single index that can be generated by the computer via web scraping or other means (eg. how long since a plant was watered, hard disk space remaining, unread email count etc.).

For the Fear and Greed index, we use the scores as follows:

- Low health images used for low index value  (**Fear**) 
- High health images used for high index value (**Greed**)

This does not mean greed is good, m'kay?
